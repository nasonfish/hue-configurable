## hue-configurable

fill out the config with the lights you have and then it will change the lights at the appropriate times, or within a minute of such.

to install, you need to use `go get github.com/savaki/go.hue` and then you should be able to run it.

[I have no guarantee this will work for a particular purpose, I don't have much experience with golang and I haven't done testing on this yet.]
